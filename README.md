Hi, I'm Jordan (he/him) — a senior software developer at Lowes working on /pd. Previously built JS things at BMW. I live in the Blue Ridge Mountains of North Carolina and try to spend most of my time outdoors.

## How I work

> If you want to build a ship, don't drum up the people to gather wood, divide the work, and give orders. Instead, teach them to yearn for the vast and endless sea. - Antoine de Saint-Exupéry

I work well when I know **why** I'm doing x thing.

I work **best** when I'm compelled to work on something.
